Welcome to Vulnerability Assessment Tool's documentation!
=========================================================

## Introduction

The Vulnerability Assessment Tool (VAT) is an open-source Python-based tool designed for detecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. With a user-friendly command-line interface and robust handling of SSL certificate verification, VAT is accessible for users of varying skill levels. The project's modular structure ensures ease of maintenance and scalability.

## Key Features

1. **SSL Verification**
* The tool rigorously handles SSL certificate verification.
* In case of SSL errors, users are prompted to choose whether to proceed without SSL verification.
* Detailed SSL errors are logged to error_log.txt, keeping user interaction clean and non-technical.
2. **XSS Vulnerability Checking**
* The tool checks for a basic form of reflected XSS.
* Sends a test payload and checks if it is reflected in the response from the target URL.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**
* Despite the complexity of the operations, the tool maintains a user-friendly command-line interface.
* Clear and concise messages are provided to the user, avoiding technical jargon and redundancy.
4. **Modular and Scalable Design**
* Code is organized into distinct modules for specific functionalities, promoting maintainability and scalability.
* The structure allows for easy addition of new features or plugins in the future.

## System Requirements

* Python 3.11.6 or higher
* `requests` library

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the tool's directory
3. Create and activate a virtual environment
4. Install dependencies

## Usage

To scan a website for XSS vulnerabilities, use the following command:

`python3 -m src.vat.vat <URL> --plugin xss`

## Options

* `<URL>`: The target website URL to scan.
* `--plugin xss`: Specifies the use of the XSS vulnerability checking plugin.
* `--no verify`: (Optional) Disable SSL verification if needed.

Example: `python3 -m src.vat.vat https://example.com --plugin xss`

This command will scan `https://example.com` for XSS vulnerabilities.
