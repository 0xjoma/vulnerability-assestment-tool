Welcome to Vulnerability Assessment Tool's documentation!
=========================================================

## Introduction


This is a Python-based tool designed to help in the detection of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. 
It features a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) and robust handling of SSL verification issues. 
The project is structured in a modular way, making it maintainable and scalable.

## Key Features


1. **SSL Verification**
* The tool rigorously handles SSL certificate verification.
* In case of SSL errors, users are prompted to choose whether to proceed without SSL verification.
* Detailed SSL errors are logged to error_log.txt, keeping user interaction clean and non-technical.
2. **XSS Vulnerability Checking**
* The tool checks for a basic form of reflected XSS.
* Sends a test payload and checks if it is reflected in the response from the target URL.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**
* Despite the complexity of the operations, the tool maintains a user-friendly command-line interface.
* Clear and concise messages are provided to the user, avoiding technical jargon and redundancy.
4. **Modular and Scalable Design**
* Code is organized into distinct modules for specific functionalities, promoting maintainability and scalability.
* The structure allows for easy addition of new features or plugins in the future.
